Some ups and downs are inevitable- talk it out with your partner, and you’ll see things falling into place. To avoid that confusion, communicate in the right way. Even then, if misunderstandings creep in, then try to let go. Throw off that extra baggage as letting go will not only improve your relationships but also provide enough room for love to grow.

This year, focus on discovering true happiness. Work out on what makes you happy and keeps your going. You might feel drained and a bit vulnerable. Charge yourself by sleeping enough and cutting down on intoxicants. 2023 ensures your overall well-being, but not without your efforts. Stomach upsets will be common in 2023, so eat meals that are light on your stomach."

Simple things like leaving flowers, love notes, or cute messages in your partner’s room can work wonders for you this time. If you’re married or dating someone, this year will be a little spicy but smacked with sugar. Your partner will demand your care and attention. The strong Venusian energy will keep the spark alive! If you’re dating, there are high chances that you’ll bump into someone interesting. And if you find one this year, do not rush into committing too quickly. Control your impulses and find out the ground realities of the person you’re dating. Marriage could be on the cards, but opposition from your family, too, might be inevitable. Things will be fine if you cultivate humility and support for your partner."

Create a proper budget and also save on the other hand- both these elements will help you to achieve financial stability. Whether it’s upgrading your skills or enjoying the returns from your investments- it’s important that you lower your expectations. Realize that you have your limitations- so instead of over-stretching, realize them and work accordingly. If you planning to change your job, then 2023 is a good time. In your current work environment-try to be alert and careful of your colleagues. If you have the habit of comparing yourself with others, then stop doing it. This will drive you to make impulsive decisions. Be patient, motivate yourself, don’t give up on your innovative ideas, and seek expert guidance before you make your investments."

However, This is the time when you’ll have to be extra careful of what you put into your body in terms of food and drink. We do not ask you to maintain a strict diet, but try to develop awareness about what you eat for your meals. Though 2023 will be a healthy year, it does hint at the onset of psychosomatic diseases. Thus, it’s your mental health that you’ll have to focus more on during this year. Do not skip your meditation routines, and eat foods that nourish your brain. Eat more walnuts, berries, fruit, green leafy vegetables, and water. These foods directly connect with your brain power and will protect your heart as well as your blood vessels. Cut down on intoxicants and avoid over-indulgence (both in food and sexual activity)."
